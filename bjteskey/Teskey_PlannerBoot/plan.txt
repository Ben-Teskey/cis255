

This program will use several arrays, but the two most important are neededNotTaken and myArr

Step 1.
myArr = get raw registration data

neededNotTaken = figure out which classes are needed but not taken by handling user input

Step 2.

Plug neededNotTaken into two functions:

getNeededRegisterable = most complex part of the program. Figure out which courses the user can take based on pre-requisites and
availability in myArr. Those of which they can take are added to neededRegisterable array, those of which they can't are added to 
neededNotRegisterable array. 

getNeededNotRegisterable = We have already been able to determine most of the courses that the user cannot register for directly
in the getNeededRegisterable function, but there will be more that the user cannot register for due to being full or just not 
being offered. Thus, we need to determine the remaining courses the user cannot register for, and add those to the 
neededNotRegisterable array.

Step 3.

Output neededRegisterable and neededNotRegisterable to the screen to aid in planning the user's schedule.
